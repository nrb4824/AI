The goal of this code is to take two data files and create a node tree with them. The run
3 search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) on them. This project was used to test my knowledge
of the search algorithms and understanding how to build them.

When running code. Make sure all files are in the same directory.

Run "javac Search.java" to compile the code
Run "java Search yourInputFile outPutFileName" where yourInputFile is a file containing two cities on the map
and outPutFileName is the name of the output file to be generated.

This code also can read in and print to standard input/output. Just use "-" instead of the input file or ouput
file name.
